     Great! you made it all the way here... Well guess I'll have to tell you a
     bit about me. I consider myself a self-taught developer although I received
     formal CS instruction, since I have learned more from solving real-life
     problems and working with other people than I ever had the opportunity
     sitting in a classroom. Now that I think about it, doesn't really sound
     like self-taught at all, let's say real-life-shaped developer.
    </p>
    <p>
     I have a pretty varied stack, including frameworks using JS, Python or
     Ruby. Although I can develop full-stack apps/solutions, I love to spend my
     time on the Frontend. That's where I thrive, and where I think I can give
     the most of me. I have this creative/techincal approach that always pushes
     me towards the UX (without being fanatic, I know "ready to deploy" means
     "ready to deá¹•loy").
    </p>
    <p>
     A couple of years ago I decided to jump into React JS. I think the paradigm
     of Components//efficienty/reusabillity is brilliant and finally a JS
     Framework (I know React is only a library ok! don't sweat it!) achieved to
     make it user friendly without tying the developer's hands. But nobody is
     perfect and React isn't the exception, that's why I decided to migrate all
     of my independent project to Solid JS. Because it just doesn't make sense
     to have so many libraries just to manage something as simple as state.{' '}

     Looking forward to meet you!
